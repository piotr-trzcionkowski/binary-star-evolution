Astrophysics III homework

Program uses BSE (Binary Star Evolution - previously available at: http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~jhurley/) code. It's an open source code for rapid simulations of binary star evolution. 

"cimpute.py" is the leading script. It's meant to generate input parameters for 4 of evolution times and star masses for various set o Period and orbit eccentricity. In each run of the main loop it generates input BSE file, runs the BSE and saves the output of BSE to output files. 

Next plot.py uses matplotlib to plot the color coded outcomes in the graphs. 

My outputs are included in the repository
